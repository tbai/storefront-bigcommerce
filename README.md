# Storefront

This is an exercise to build a storefront web app. 
The project was generated using Angular 2 and redux and you can see it live at: `https://tbai.github.io/storefront-bigcommerce`

## Installation

* Run `npm install -g angular-cli@1.0.0-beta.17`
* Run `npm install`

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
